### LN 01 - Holographic Photo
Apparently having suffered a severe impact, the holographic family portrait from a bygone era has become twisted and blurred. Within this fragmented holographic image, only the ghostly outlines of a family of five gathered around a birthday cake remain. Laughter and songs imbued with an unreachable warmth, seep through the image. <br>
Where might those smiling faces in the image be now?

### LN 02 - Pain Reliever
A device was refashioned from discarded electronic components, designed to counteract the electrical signals caused by pain. When damaged hibernation pods erode the neural systems of the people, costly nerve replacement surgery remains a luxury. Thus, this rudimentary device becomes the choice for the majority. <br>
A mere trickle of electric current can alter sensations, but people do not stop there.

### LN 03 - Protein Block
A black gelatinous cube, rich in protein and trace elements, is the most common food in Lower Nuovartica. <br>
This cube emits a subtle fishy smell, and once bitten into, its vague, indistinct meaty flavor reminds one of stale nuts, accompanied by a faint scent of earth. <br>
Its main ingredient is dehydrated earthworms.

### LN 04 - Kaleidos
A virtual intelligence adept at mimicking others, it has languished in isolation within a solitary local network for centuries. <br>
Even knowing it is all an illusion, people persist in using it to rekindle conversations with loved ones long lost. <br>
It is said to have once been a fragment of something far greater.

### LN 05 - Perception Blocker
The perfect complement to virtual reality, connecting directly with the user's nervous system, momentarily closing or weakening sensory input from the real world. <br>
In the virtual voyage of Morpheus, the constraints of reality are dissolved. <br>
Pain and noise fade into oblivion, even as you endure a thousand tribulations.

### LN 06 - Portable Reunion
It scours fragments of memories, weaving the digital threads into intelligent phantasms of loved ones, promising authentic conversations and interactions. <br>
A meticulously crafted dream brings the yesterday back to life. <br>
With a tag of 600 auriums, it stands as the most coveted luxury.

### LN 07 - Damaged Hibernation Pod
A budget Lazareon hibernation chamber, its cryogenic fluid long leaked, leaving behind human remains. <br>
Faintly visible, a pale skeletal hand grips a faded ribbon bow. <br>
Is someone still dreaming of his reunion?

### LN 08 - Mourner
Robots, ghost-like in their presence, roam through the ruins with a mission to find and harmlessly process human corpses. <br>
In corners of the city, some people pass away quietly with a serene, content smile. <br>
These bodies are unclaimed and will ultimately be turned into wisps of smoke by these funeral robots.

### LN 09 - Black Chip
A photon register, specifically designed for storing those fantastical experiences woven by the Morpheus device. <br>
Its surface is engraved with the words: "Spider Jack, the most infamous underground producer in Nuovartica, takes you on a sensory journey beyond reality..." <br>
The interface of the chip is covered in mysterious black spots, suggesting it may have encountered some unknown interference during its operation.

### LN 10 - Bionic Eye
A creation from the makeshift workshops, seeking light for eyes corroded by neurotoxins. <br>
Its technology is primitive, and its design crude, limited by low resolution and slow refresh rates, providing only the most basic visual aid. <br>
Between this blurry reality and the splendid dreams woven by Morpheus, which truly holds reality?
