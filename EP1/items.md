### LN 01 - Holographic Photo
Apparently having suffered a severe impact, the family portrait from a bygone era has become twisted and blurred. <br>
Within this fragmented holographic image, only the ghostly outlines of a family of five gathered around a birthday cake remain. Laughter and songs imbued with an unreachable warmth, seep through the image. <br>
Where might those smiling faces in the image be now?

### LN 02 - Pain Reliever
A device was refashioned from discarded electronic components, designed to counteract the electrical signals caused by pain. <br>
When damaged hibernation pods erode the neural systems of the people, costly nerve replacement surgery remains a luxury. Thus, this rudimentary device becomes the choice for the majority. <br>
A mere trickle of electric current can alter sensations, but people do not stop there.

### LN 03 - Protein Block
A black gelatinous cube, rich in protein and trace elements, is the most common food in Lower Nuovartica. <br>
This cube emits a subtle fishy smell, and once bitten into, its vague, indistinct meaty flavor reminds one of stale nuts, accompanied by a faint scent of earth. <br>
Its main ingredient is dehydrated earthworms.

### LN 04 - Kaleidos
A virtual intelligence adept at mimicking others, it has languished in isolation within a solitary local network for centuries. <br>
Even knowing it is all an illusion, people persist in using it to rekindle conversations with loved ones long lost. <br>
It is said to have once been a fragment of something far greater.

### LN 05 - Perception Blocker
The perfect complement to virtual reality, connecting directly with the user's nervous system, momentarily closing or weakening sensory input from the real world. <br>
In the virtual voyage of Morpheus, the constraints of reality are dissolved. <br>
Pain and noise fade into oblivion, even as you endure a thousand tribulations.

### LN 06 - Portable Reunion
A meticulously crafted dream brings the yesterday once more. <br>
With a tag of 600 auriums, it stands as the most coveted luxury. <br>
All is fleeting; only loss and longing endure.

### LN 07 - Damaged Hibernation Pod
A budget Lazareon hibernation chamber, its cryogenic fluid long leaked, leaving behind human remains. <br>
Faintly visible, a pale skeletal hand grips a faded ribbon bow. <br>
Is someone still dreaming of his reunion?

### LN 08 - Mourner
Robots, ghost-like in their presence, roam through the ruins with a mission to find and process human corpses. <br>
The unclaimed bodies with faces still bearing smiles, are finally reduced to a wisp of smoke by the funeral machines. <br>
Their names and dreams, along with the moon they dreamt of last night, dissolve together into the endless night sky.

### LN 09 - Black Chip
A photon register, specifically designed for storing those fantastical experiences woven by the Morpheus device. <br>
It holds Spider Jack's work, Crimson Chalice, notorious for its sordid and grotesque sensory onslaught. <br>
The chip interface bears several scorch marks, as if it had endured some unknown interference during operation.

### LN 10 - Bionic Eye
A creation from the makeshift workshops, seeking light for eyes corroded by neurotoxins. <br>
Its technology is primitive, and its design crude, limited by low resolution and slow refresh rates, providing only the most basic visual aid. <br>
Between this blurry reality and the splendid dreams woven by Morpheus, which truly holds reality?
