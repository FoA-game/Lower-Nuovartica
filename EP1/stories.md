## LN A - Neon Ruins

Known as the Neon Ruins, the streets at night shimmer with unending glows from cheap neon lights, weaving a tapestry of vivid shadows amidst the fog. Scattered around are the ruins of skyscrapers that once reached for the skies, now sprawling like the remains of colossal beings, echoing the lost splendor of the city.

When people awaken from their outdated, cheap hibernation pods, they find themselves bereft of everything—family, friendships, a past life—all gone, leaving only perpetual agony in their wake. This pain appears to be a cruel testament to prolonged exposure to neurotoxins. Since the Great Disruption, the ruin has become like a bottomless swamp, endlessly swallowing up those who are lost, destitute, and without anything left.

Under the neon lights, cheap electronic drugs and virtual realities become their sanctuaries, allowing them to escape the harshness of reality into a fabric of fantasies. Their mind drifts in digitally crafted dreams while their bodies lie forsaken in the shattered world.


## LN B - Electronical bliss

In the shadows of the dark market, a specialty "cocktail" known as "Vol de Nuit" has recently risen to fame. Its opening notes feature the slow release of serotonin, evoking a light and uplifting sensation. This is followed by a tumultuous symphony of adrenaline and cortisol, pushing the body to the peak of sensory experience. As this intense flight nears its end, carefully calibrated doses of dopamine and endorphins flood the system, bringing the user into a profound state of tranquility, akin to safely landing after a storm.

At the heart of these experiences lies the Neural Resonator—a small device ingeniously reconstructed by the craftsmen of Lower Nuovartica using discarded electronic waste from the upper city. These devices directly connect to the human nervous system, precisely regulating hormone secretion through electrical signals, orchestrating a rhythm of sensations and emotions. Vol de Nuit is merely one of the most celebrated products in this category. Despite the crude technology, it is more than enough to enthrall its users.

However, the rising misuse of Neural Resonators has brought alarming consequences. Local clinics report a surge in cases of neurological collapse, endocrine dysfunction, and even sudden death caused by improper use in the past three months. Some doctors warn that Neural Resonators can induce severe physiological dependency and inflict irreversible damage on long-term neural functions.


## LN C - Shattered Butterfly Dreams

"Hey, guess what I did? My family and the Caldwells went camping at Cedar Hill. Emily prepared a bunch of meat pies, but as usual, the brisket was dry and way too salty. I almost choked to death, I swear. I complained a bit, and can you believe she threatened to use my butt as a filling next time? However, Sophie and little Tomy got along well; they picked a bunch of wild berries so sour that I promised to make them jam when we got home. The funniest part was Johnson bragging about his barbecuing skills, and then he set his beard on fire! He yelled and ran around until his boyfriend quickly doused his face with water..."

"That'll be 17 dollars, please." a cold voice interrupted his story.

“These were real… weren’t they?” His voice was hoarse at first, trailing off into a long, heavy silence.

Finally, he couldn’t hold back. “It’s all fake! Every bit of it! I can’t find my wife, my kids… They’re gone! You can’t keep feeding me these lies!”

"You can see them again. Spend happy time with them." a voice replied flatly. "Morpheus is real enough. For you, what difference does it make?"


## LN D - Demolition Notice

Dear Downtown Residents,

We extend our deepest greetings to you as well as our regrets for the message we must convey. In alignment with our city’s future development plans and sustainability goals, we are initiating a crucial infrastructure project - the Arcadix Dam - to secure the long-term welfare of human society.

However, we must acknowledge that implementing this project will result in the submergence of the entire lower area. We are acutely aware of the significant and direct impact this decision will have on your lives. Therefore, we pledge to take all necessary measures to ensure your smooth relocation and proper resettlement.

New Housing Arrangements: You will be relocated to new residential areas equipped with basic amenities to ensure the quality of your living standards.

New Employment Opportunities: We will create new job opportunities to help you rebuild your life. We firmly believe that meaningful work can enhance personal value.

Addiction Intervention and Support: We will provide professional mental health support and treatment services to help those who have developed a dependency on electronic drugs and virtual reality gradually overcome these dependencies.

We look forward to building a brighter and better future with you in our new community.

Sincerely,

Civilization Restoration Committee in White Tower


## LN E - Black Redemption

Rain incessantly blankets the city in a mist, mourning the silent withering of life. In this neon wasteland, death is an unexpected shadow that quietly descends upon everyone. A few perish from accidents or complications caused by neural disarray, but many more from malnutrition. It's not for lack of resources — the abundant waste from Upper Nuovartica could stave off hunger — but because people are lost in the ephemeral worlds of neural resonators or the Morpheus system, neglecting the physical needs of the real world.

"Ulixes saved my life," Eliot Gray murmured, his gaze fixed on the nutrient capsule in his trembling hand. "They hacked into the neural resonators, forcibly pulling me out of those fabricated dreams. If it weren’t for them, I’d probably already be another cold corpse on the streets."

"But you hate them, don’t you?" the visitor across from him asked.

Eliot fell silent for a moment, rain dripping from his hair. "Yes, I hate them. They made me live, but the reality is, I have nothing left but pain! I’m alive, trapped in a hell without an exit, counting the days to see how much longer I can endure."
