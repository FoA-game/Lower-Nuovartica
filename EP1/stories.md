## LN A - Neon Ruins

They call this place the Neon Ruins. At night, the streets are veiled in mist, with cheap neon lights flickering endlessly, weaving a tapestry of iridescent shadows. Scattered around are the remains of skyscrapers—structures that once pierced the firmament, now sprawled across the streets like the corpses of giants, echoing the lost splendor of the city.

A year ago, when Kiki awoke from her dilapidated hibernation pod, searing pain engulfed her like a wildfire, leaving nothing in her mind but the reverberation of agony. It was a sharp, ceaseless, and unspeakable pain—a cruel testimony to the neurotoxins released by the degraded cryofluids. Like so many others else here, she quickly realized she had nothing left——her family, her friends, her life before it all—all drowned in the aftermath of the Great Disruption, reduced to blurred shadows lingering in the depths of her memory. This wasteland has become like a bottomless swamp, endlessly swallowing up those who are lost, destitute, and without anything left.

Under the neon lights, cheap electronic drugs and virtual realities become their sanctuaries. Kiki stumbled through the streets, the faint glow of neon reflecting off her pale face. In the distance, a faint cry reached her ears—a child kneeling beside a lifeless body. Kiki felt as though she should cry too, but in the end, there was just silence. Instead, her fingers brushed against the connector at the nape of her neck, and she closed her eyes, surrendering her consciousness to the digitally crafted dreams while her body lay forsaken in the shattered reality.


## LN B - Electronical Bliss

In the shadows of the dark market, a specialty "cocktail" known as "Vol de Nuit" has recently risen to fame. Its opening notes feature the slow release of serotonin, evoking a light and uplifting sensation. This is followed by a tumultuous symphony of adrenaline and cortisol, pushing the body to the peak of sensory experience. As this intense flight nears its end, carefully calibrated doses of dopamine and endorphins flood the system, bringing the user into a profound state of tranquility, akin to safely landing after a storm.

At the heart of these experiences lies the Neural Resonator—a small device ingeniously reconstructed by the craftsmen of Lower Nuovartica using discarded electronic waste from the upper city. These devices directly connect to the human nervous system, precisely regulating hormone secretion through electrical signals, orchestrating a rhythm of sensations and emotions. Vol de Nuit is merely one of the most celebrated products in this category. Despite the crude technology, it is more than enough to enthrall its users.

However, the rising misuse of Neural Resonators has brought alarming consequences. Local clinics report a surge in cases of neurological collapse, endocrine dysfunction, and even sudden death caused by improper use in the past three months. Some doctors warn that Neural Resonators can induce severe physiological dependency and inflict irreversible damage on long-term neural functions.


## LN C - Shattered Butterfly Dreams

"Hey, guess what I did? My family and the Caldwells went camping at Cedar Hill. Emily prepared a bunch of meat pies, but as usual, the brisket was dry and way too salty. I almost choked to death, I swear. I complained a bit, and can you believe she threatened to use my butt as a filling next time? However, Sophie and little Tomy got along well; they picked a bunch of wild berries so sour that I promised to make them jam when we got home. The funniest part was Johnson bragging about his barbecuing skills, and then he set his beard on fire! He yelled and ran around until his boyfriend quickly doused his face with water..."

"That'll be 17 dollars, please." a cold voice interrupted his story.

“These were real… weren’t they?” His voice was hoarse at first, trailing off into a long, heavy silence.

Finally, he couldn’t hold back. “It’s all fake! Every bit of it! I can’t find my wife, my kids… They’re gone! You can’t keep feeding me these lies!”

"You can see them again. Spend happy time with them." a voice replied flatly. "Morpheus is real enough. For you, what difference does it make?"

## LN E - Black Redemption

Rain incessantly blankets the city in a mist. Here, dreams are too many and too deep, spilling over into reality; while death is an uninvited shadow, quietly descending upon everyone. A few succumb to accidents or complications from neural disorders, but far more perish under malnutrition. This is not due to a lack of resources—Upper Novartica provides enough food to sustain life—but because people, ensnared in illusions, have abandoned the physical needs of their reality.

Amid this void and despair, a hacker group known as Ulixes emerged from the shadows. They see themselves as saviors of lost souls, hacking into and altering Neural Resonators and Morpheus systems to awaken those trapped in their illusions: "Your pain is real, and your will is free."

"Ulixes saved my life," Eliot Gray murmured, his gaze fixed on the nutrient capsule in his trembling hand. "They hacked into the neural resonators, forcibly pulling me out of those fabricated dreams. If it weren’t for them, I’d probably already be another cold corpse on the streets."

"But you hate them, don’t you?" the visitor across from him asked.

Eliot fell silent for a moment, rain dripping from his hair. "Yes, I hate them. They made me live, but the reality is, I have nothing left but pain! I’m alive, trapped in a hell without an exit."
